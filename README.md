# Debugging 2

This repository contains the solutions to the Debugging 2 exercise, where we worked on two different tasks: Vowel Remover and Letter Counter. This work has done in collaboration with Sarah Clements.

## Vowel Remover

The Vowel Remover task involved debugging a class that takes a string and removes all vowels from it. The 'VowelRemover' class has an 'initialize' method that takes a string and a 'remove_vowels' method that returns the input string without any vowels. The code was debugged, and unit tests were added to ensure its functionality.

### Files:

- 'lib/vowel_remover.rb': Contains the 'VowelRemover' class implementation.
- 'spec/vowel_remover_spec.rb': Contains the RSpec tests for the 'VowelRemover' class.

## Letter Counter

The Letter Counter challenge focused on debugging a class that takes a string and calculates the most common letter in it. The 'LetterCounter' class has an 'initialize' method that takes a string and a 'calculate_most_common' method that takes a string and a 'calculate_most_common' method that returns the most common letter and its count in the input string. The code was debugged, and unit tests were added to ensure its functionality.

### Files:

- 'lib/letter_counter.rb': Contains the 'LetterCounter' class implementation
- 'spec/letter_counter_spec.rb': Contains the RSpec tests for the 'LetterCounter' class

## Usage

To run the RSpec tests, navigate to the projects's root directory and run the following command: rspec
This command will execute all the tests in the 'spec' directory and display the results.
